\title{Visualize a Single Tree from an Rforce Forest}
\usage{
printTree(forest, treeIndex)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{An object of class \code{Rforce} containing the trained forest
and a valid external C pointer in \code{`_external_forest_C_Ptr`}.}

\item{treeIndex}{An integer specifying the index of the tree to visualize.
Must be between \code{1} and \code{forest\$numTrees}.}
}
\value{
A DiagrammeR graph object representing the visualized decision tree.
Additionally, a message is printed showing the location of the temporary
DOT file.
}
\description{
This function extracts a single decision tree from an \code{Rforce} forest,
generates its Graphviz DOT representation via the underlying C backend,
and renders it using \pkg{DiagrammeR}. The DOT file is stored temporarily
and automatically removed after the R session.
}
\details{
Internally, this function:
\enumerate{
\item Validates input.
\item Creates a temporary \code{.dot} file.
\item Calls the C function \code{R_PrintTree} via \code{.Call} to write
the DOT graph representation of the tree.
\item Displays the tree structure using \code{DiagrammeR::grViz()}.
}

The DOT file persists only for the current R session and is stored in a
temporary directory. It is automatically cleaned up when the session ends.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming `rf_model` is an Rforce object with at least one tree:
printTree(rf_model, treeIndex = 1)
}

}
