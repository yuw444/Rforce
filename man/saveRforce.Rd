\title{Save an Rforce Object to Disk}
\usage{
saveRforce(forest, file, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{An object of class \code{"Rforce"} representing the fitted random
survival forest.}

\item{file}{A character string specifying the directory path where the object
should be saved. The directory will be created by the underlying C routine
if it does not already exist.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{saveRDS()}, such as
\code{compress} or \code{version}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. A message is not printed, but files are written
to the specified directory.
}
\description{
\code{saveRforce()} saves a trained \code{Rforce} object to disk, including both
the R-side metadata (e.g., model settings, variable importance, parameters) and
the full C-based forest structure. The external C pointer is handled separately
and excluded from the saved \code{.rds} file to ensure portability and session
safety.
}
\details{
The function performs the following actions:
\enumerate{
\item Calls the native routine \code{R_SaveRforce} to serialize and write the
forest structure (all trees) to the specified directory.
\item Removes the external C pointer (\code{_external_forest_C_Ptr}) from the
R object to prevent session-specific pointer issues.
\item Saves the remaining R-side object to \code{Rforce.rds} using
\code{saveRDS()}.
}

The resulting directory structure is compatible with \code{loadRforce()}, which
restores both the R object and its native forest pointer.
