\title{Load an Rforce Object from Disk}
\usage{
loadRforce(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string specifying the directory containing the saved
\code{Rforce} object. The directory must include \code{Rforce.rds} and a
single forest data subdirectory created by \code{saveRforce()}.}
}
\value{
A fully functional \code{Rforce} object with a reconstructed external
forest pointer, ready for prediction, visualization, or further analysis.
}
\description{
\code{loadRforce()} restores a previously saved \code{Rforce} object from a
specified directory. It reconstructs both the R-side object (stored as
\code{Rforce.rds}) and the associated C++ forest structure via the
\code{R_LoadRforce} routine, ensuring full functionality.
}
\details{
The function performs the following tasks:
\enumerate{
\item Reads the \code{Rforce.rds} file to reconstruct the R-side object.
\item Validates that the restored object inherits class \code{"Rforce"}.
\item Locates the associated forest data directory.
\item Calls the native routine \code{R_LoadRforce} to rebuild the C-allocated
forest structure, restoring the external pointer at
\code{_external_forest_C_Ptr}.
}

If the directory structure is invalid or the C pointer fails to load, an
error is raised.
