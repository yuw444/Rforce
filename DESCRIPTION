Description: Composite Endpoints includes both fatal(terminal) and non-fatal(terminal) events, we convert long-formatted patient observed time
    to wide-formatted Counting Process Information Units(CPIU) whille taking into account dependent censoring effects of fatal events on non-fatal events,
    with pseudo-risk time at each CPIU. Later, we implement Random Forests algorithm to CPIU data for risk prediction and variable importance evaluation.
